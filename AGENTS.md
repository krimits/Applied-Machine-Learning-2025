# AGENTS

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and CSV datasets used in an
Applied Machine Learning course.

## Goals for agents
- Keep notebooks reproducible and readable.
- Prefer minimal, focused changes.
- Preserve existing file names unless asked to rename.

## Project layout
- Notebooks: *.ipynb in the repo root.
- Datasets: *.csv in the repo root.
- Figures: *.png in the repo root.

## Working guidelines
- Do not modify raw CSV files unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer editing notebooks with minimal output; clear large outputs
  if they are not required for the task.
- Keep notebook code in Python.
- Avoid heavy downloads; use existing data files when possible.
- If adding new assets, use descriptive names and keep them in the
  repo root unless instructed otherwise.

## Testing
- There are no automated tests. If needed, run the relevant notebook
  cells or a lightweight Python snippet to validate changes.
